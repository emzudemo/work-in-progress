The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user is unable to view it for some reason. This can be due to

- a slow connection
- an error in the src attribute
- or if the user is using a screen reader.

However, adding text descriptions to every image means a lot of work for editors. As a result, alt text is often forgotten or treated as an afterthought.

Image-to-text AI models can easily automate the creation of alternative text. And Altify is here to make it easy to add them to your website.
