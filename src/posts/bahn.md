The notorious Deutsche Bahn had to sell the Deutschlandticket in a rush. They called us because they saw that a lot of users cancelled during the process of puchasing the ticket. On top of that a lot of complaints came in because users weren't able to cancel their subscription to the ticket. 

In just three weeks we conducted a series of usertests and provided Deutsche Bahn with quick fixes and better solutions for the long-term. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to talk about details but let's say: the process – and their numbers – got better real quick.
